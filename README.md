# CTF Cup 2020 (A/D part)

The contest is driven by classic rules (Attack-Defense [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security)). Each team is given a set of vulnerable services. Organizers regulary fill services with private information â€” the flags. The goal of each team is to find vulnerabilities, fix them in their services and exploit them in order to get flags from other teams.
